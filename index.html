    <p >My whole life I have been physical active. From playing football as a kid to working as a personal trainer as an adult. The joy of being able to push your body pass its limits and accomplish a goal is what I have always lived for. Being active is something I have always been able to turn to when I need to dig deep and discover something new about myself. It has always been the tool that has allowed me focus and stay determined and accomplish anything I set my mind to.  </p>

<p>Stepping into the coding scene is something I am excited about. Learning the tools necessary to build websites and mobile app is the greatest world skill to have in this generation. It’s so versatile and powerful as a software engineer, we control the trends and flow of how the world views the internet. I am always thinking of different ways to bring my background and life experiences into my coding process; blending the Intellical concepts of coding with my life experience I strive to provide a better user experience.  </p>
